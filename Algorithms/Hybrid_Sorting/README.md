# Hybrid sorting algorithms

A hybrid algorithm is an algorithm that combines two or more other algorithms that solve the same problem, and is mostly used in programming languages like C++, either choosing one (depending on the data), or switching between them over the course of the algorithm. This is generally done to combine desired features of each, so that the overall algorithm is better than the individual components.
