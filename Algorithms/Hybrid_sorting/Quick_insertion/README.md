# Hybrid of quick and insertion sort

Quicksort algorithm is efficient if the size of the input is very large. But, insertion sort is more efficient than quick sort in case of small arrays as the number of comparisons and swaps are less compared to quicksort. So we combine the two algorithms to sort efficiently using both approaches.
