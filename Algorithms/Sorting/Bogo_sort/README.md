# Bogo Sort 

This is an implementation of the Bogo Sort algorithm in C++. Bogo Sort is a highly inefficient and impractical sorting algorithm, often used for educational purposes and as a joke due to its abysmal performance.

## Bogo Sort Algorithm

Bogo Sort works by randomly shuffling the elements of an array and checking if they are sorted. If the array is not sorted, it repeats the process of shuffling until it happens to find a sorted arrangement of elements. There is no guarantee of when or if it will ever sort the array, making it a highly unreliable and inefficient sorting method.

## Time Complexity

The average-case time complexity of Bogo Sort is O((n+1)!), where 'n' is the number of elements in the array. This makes Bogo Sort incredibly inefficient and impractical for sorting even moderately sized arrays. It is not suitable for any real-world sorting tasks and is used mainly for educational or humorous purposes.
