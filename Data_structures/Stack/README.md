# C++ Stack Implementation

This is a simple C++ implementation of a stack data structure with various features, including copy and move operations, resizable capacity, and a clear method.

## Overview

This C++ Stack implementation provides a flexible and efficient stack data structure that can be used for various applications. It includes the following features:

- Pushing elements onto the stack.
- Popping elements from the stack.
- Accessing the top element without removing it.
- Checking if the stack is empty.
- Getting the current size of the stack.
- Clearing the stack.
- Copy constructor and copy assignment operator.
- Move constructor and move assignment operator.
- Resizable capacity to handle a dynamic number of elements.

## Usage

To use this Stack implementation in your C++ project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Include the `"Stack.hpp"` header in your C++ source files where you want to use the `Stack` class.

3. Create a `Stack` object for the desired data type, e.g., `Stack<int> myStack;`.

4. Use the available methods to interact with the stack, such as `push`, `pop`, `top`, `empty`, `size`, and `clear`.
